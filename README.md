# AiCore Scenario - Multimodal Property Intelligence System

This project aims to develop a framework to systematically train, tune, and evaluate a wide range of machine learning models, from simple regression to neural network models, that can be applied to various datasets.

## Milestone 1
In Milestone 1, the focus was on setting up the development environment. This involved installing the necessary tools and libraries required to run the program. A virtual environment was created to keep the dependencies for the project isolated from the other projects on the machine. This step helped to avoid potential conflicts with other projects.

## Milestone 2 & 3
In Milestone 3, the script `clean_tabular_data.py` was created, which cleans a tabular dataset of _Airbnb_ property listings. It removes or fills missing values and combines strings, returning the cleaned dataset. This script can be run as a standalone program or imported into other scripts, providing an efficient solution for data cleaning tasks. The output file `clean_tabular_data.csv` can be used for further analysis or machine learning applications.
